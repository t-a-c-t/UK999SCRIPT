Hello Users,

This is a simplified and immersive 999 Emergency Call System designed specifically for vMenu-based FiveM servers. It enhances roleplay by allowing players to quickly report emergencies to law enforcement officers (LEOs) in-game.

Features:

Simple Command: Players can trigger an emergency call using:
/999 <message> – Example: /999 Armed robbery in progress at Legion Square!

ACE Permissions: Only LEOs with the appropriate ACE permission will receive the emergency alerts.

Immersive Notifications: LEOs are notified with a clean, bottom-right notification that includes:

Caller’s Name and ID

Street Name (or Cross-Street)

The Emergency Message

A subtle alert sound for increased realism

Automatic Dismissal: Alerts auto-dismiss after a configurable duration.

Fully Configurable:

Adjust alert duration, notification style, and permissions to fit your server’s needs.

Works out-of-the-box with minimal setup – just add the ACE permissions and start enhancing your LEO roleplay! 🚓
